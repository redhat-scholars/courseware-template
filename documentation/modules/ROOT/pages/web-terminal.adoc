If you do not have or do not wish to install the various client tools for
performing the exercises detailed in this workshop, you can deploy a
web-based terminal container image into your OpenShift environment.

[#prerequisites]
== Prerequisites
You will first need a Project where you can deploy the web terminal. Go to
your OpenShift web console, login, and switch to the _Developer_ context.

Next, click _Project:_ at the top of the page, and create a new Project. You
can call it whatever you like, but the instructions will refer to a project
called `Terminal`.

[#deploy-terminal]
== Deploy the Terminal
Once you have created your `Terminal` Project, you can then click the _+Add_
button.

From the list of options, choose _Container Image_.

Where it says _Enter an image name_, you will want to paste the URI for the
TTYD image that we use to provide the terminal experience:

[.console-input]
[source,text]
----
quay.io/redhat-scholars/ttyd-openshift
----

You can accept all the defaults, and click _Create_ at the bottom of the
page.

[#access-terminal]
== Accessing the Terminal
Once you have deployed the terminal image, in the topology view you will see
something that looks like this:

Click on the little pop-out arrow at the top right of the circle, and this
will open the web terminal.

Back in the OpenShift web console, if you click your name in the upper right
corner, you will see _Copy Login Command_. Click it, and you will be prompted
for your username and password. Enter it, submit, and you will see _Display
Token_.

When you click _Display Token_, you will finally see an `oc login` command
that looks something like the following:

[source]
----
oc login --token=zzzz --server=https://api.cluster-domain.com:6443
----

Copy and paste the login command into the web terminal, and now you can
access OpenShift with all of the tools you need to perform the exercises in
this workshop!
